# Horiseon Webpage

## Description

The company Horiseon works on providing accesibility to websites to attract more cutomers as well as a higher rating on Google. This project focuses on adding those same ideas to thier webpage.

- This project was created in order to add accesability to the Horiseon website. With these additions a broder scope of people will be able to access thier webpage. 
- This project helped foster an HTML file that is easier to follow in the longrun. If additions needed to be made to the code an engineer could follow the HTML semantics in a logical progression,
- In this project I learned usefullness of HTML semantics. The original code was hard to follow and I found myself using ChromeDev tools more than what should be nessesary.
